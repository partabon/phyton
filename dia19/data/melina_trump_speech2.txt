thank you very much  thank you  you have all been very kind to donald and me  to our young son barron  and to our whole family  it s a very nice welcome and we re excited to be with you at this historic convention  i am so proud of your choice for president of the united states  my husband  donald j  trump 

and i can assure you  he is moved by this great honor  the 2016 republican primaries were fierce and started with many candidates  17 to be exact  and i know that donald agrees with me when i mention how talented all of them are  they deserve respect and gratitude from all of us 

however  when it comes to my husband  i will say that i am definitely biased  and for good reason 

i have been with donald for 18 years and i have been aware of his love for this country since we first met  he never had a hidden agenda when it comes to his patriotism  because  like me  he loves this country so much  i was born in slovenia  a small  beautiful and then communist country in central europe  my sister ines  who is an incredible woman and a friend  and i were raised by my wonderful parents  my elegant and hard working mother amalia introduced me to fashion and beauty  my father viktor instilled in me a passion for business and travel  their integrity  compassion and intelligence reflects to this day on me and for my love of family and america 

from a young age  my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect  they taught and showed me values and morals in their daily life  that is a lesson that i continue to pass along to our son  and we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow  because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them 

i am fortunate for my heritage  but also for where it brought me today  i traveled the world while working hard in the incredible arena of fashion  after living and working in milan and paris  i arrived in new york city 20 years ago  and i saw both the joys and the hardships of daily life  on july 28  2006  i was very proud to become a citizen of the united states — the greatest privilege on planet earth  i cannot  or will not  take the freedoms this country offers for granted  but these freedoms have come with a price so many times  the sacrifices made by our veterans are reminders to us of this  i would like to take this moment to recognize an amazing veteran  the great sen  bob dole  and let us thank all of our veterans in the arena today  and those across our great country  we are all truly blessed to be here  that will never change 

i can tell you with certainty that my husband has been concerned about our country for as long as i have known him  with all of my heart  i know that he will make a great and lasting difference  donald has a deep and unbounding determination and a never give up attitude  i have seen him fight for years to get a project done — or even started — and he does not give up! if you want someone to fight for you and your country  i can assure you  he is the  guy  

he will never  ever  give up  and  most importantly  he will never  ever  let you down  donald is  and always has been  an amazing leader  now  he will go to work for you  his achievements speak for themselves  and his performance throughout the primary campaign proved that he knows how to win  he also knows how to remain focused on improving our country — on keeping it safe and secure  he is tough when he has to be but he is also kind and fair and caring  this kindness is not always noted  but it is there for all to see  that is one reason i fell in love with him to begin with 

donald is intensely loyal  to family  friends  employees  country  he has the utmost respect for his parents  mary and fred  to his sisters maryanne and elizabeth  to his brother robert and to the memory of his late brother fred  his children have been cared for and mentored to the extent that even his adversaries admit they are an amazing testament to who he is as a man and a father  there is a great deal of love in the trump family  that is our bond  and that is our strength 

yes  donald thinks big  which is especially important when considering the presidency of the united states  no room for small thinking  no room for small results  donald gets things done 

our country is underperforming and needs new leadership  leadership is also what the world needs  donald wants our country to move forward in the most positive of ways  everyone wants change  donald is the only one that can deliver it  we should not be satisfied with stagnation  donald wants prosperity for all americans  we need new programs to help the poor and opportunities to challenge the young  there has to be a plan for growth — only then will fairness result 

my husband s experience exemplifies growth and successful passage of opportunity to the next generation  his success indicates inclusion rather than division  my husband offers a new direction  welcoming change  prosperity and greater cooperation among peoples and nations  donald intends to represent all the people  not just some of the people  that includes christians and jews and muslims  it includes hispanics and african americans and asians  and the poor and the middle class  throughout his career  donald has successfully worked with people of many faiths and with many nations 

like no one else  i have seen the talent  the energy  the tenacity  the resourceful mind  and the simple goodness of heart that god gave to donald trump  now is the time to use those gifts as never before  for purposes far greater than ever before  and he will do this better than anyone else can — and it won t even be close  everything depends on it  for our cause and for our country 

people are counting on him — all the millions of you who have touched us so much with your kindness and your confidence  you have turned this unlikely campaign into a movement that is still gaining in strength and number  the primary season  and its toughness  is behind us  let s all come together in a national campaign like no other 

the race will be hard fought  all the way to november  there will be good times and hard times and unexpected turns — it would not be a trump contest without excitement and drama  but through it all  my husband will remain focused on only one thing  this beautiful country  that he loves so much 

if i am honored to serve as first lady  i will use that wonderful privilege to try to help people in our country who need it the most  one of the many causes dear to my heart is helping children and women  you judge a society by how it treats its citizens  we must do our best to ensure that every child can live in comfort and security  with the best possible education  as citizens of this great nation  it is kindness  love  and compassion for each other that will bring us together — and keep us together  these are the values donald and i will bring to the white house  my husband is ready to lead this great nation  he is ready to fight  every day  to give our children the better future they deserve  ladies and gentlemen  donald j  trump is ready to serve and lead this country as the next president of the united states 

thank you  god bless you  and god bless america
