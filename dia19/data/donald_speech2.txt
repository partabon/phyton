chief justice roberts  president carter  president clinton president bush  fellow americans and people of the world – thank you 
 we the citizens of america have now joined a great national effort to rebuild our county and restore its promise for all our people 
together we will determine the course of america for many  many years to come 
together we will face challenges  we will confront hardships  but we will get the job done 
every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power 
and we are grateful to president obama and first lady michelle obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition  they have been magnificent  thank you 
today’s ceremony  however  has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another – but transferring it from washington dc and giving it back to you the people 
for too long a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost 
washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth  politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed the establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country 
their victories have not been your victories  their triumphs have not been your triumphs  while they have celebrated there has been little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land 
that all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment  it belongs to you  it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across america today 
this is your day this is your celebration and this – the united states of america – is your country what truly matters is not what party controls our government but that this government is controlled by the people 
today  january 20 2017  will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer  everyone is listening to you now 
you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement –  the likes of which the world has never seen before 
at the centre of this movement is a crucial conviction – that a nation exists to serve its citizens americans want great schools for their children  safe neighbourhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves 
these are just and reasonable demands mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities  rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation 
an education system flushed with cash  but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge  and the crime and the gangs and the drugs which deprive people of so much unrealised potential 
we are one nation  and their pain is our pain  their dreams are our dreams  we share one nation  one home and one glorious destiny 
today i take an oath of allegiance to all americans  for many decades  we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of american industry  subsidised the armies of other countries  while allowing the sad depletion of our own military 
we ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while america’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay 
we have made other countries rich while the wealth  strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon 
one by one  shutters have closed on our factories without even a thought about the millions and millions of those who have been left behind 
but that is the past and now we are looking only to the future 
we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city  in every foreign capital  in every hall of power – from this day on a new vision will govern our land – from this day onwards it is only going to be america first – america first!
every decision on trade  on taxes  on immigration  on foreign affairs will be made to benefit american workers and american families 
protection will lead to great prosperity and strength  i will fight for you with every bone in my body and i will never ever let you down 
america will start winning again  america will start winning like never before 
we will bring back our jobs  we will bring back our borders  we will bring back our wealth  we will bring back our dreams 
we will bring new roads and high roads and bridges and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation 
we will get our people off welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with american hands and american labour 
we will follow two simple rules – buy american and hire american 
we see good will with the nations of the world but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their nations first 
we will shine for everyone to follow we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones  and untie the world against radical islamic terrorism which we will eradicate from the face of the earth 
at the bed rock of our politics will be an allegiance to the united states and we will discover new allegiance to each other  there is no room for prejudice 
the bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when god’s people live together in unity when america is united  america is totally unstoppable
there is no fear  we are protected and will always be protected by the great men and women of our military and most importantly we will be protected by god 
finally  we must think big and dream even bigger  as americans  we know we live as a nation only when it is striving 
we will no longer accept politicians who are always complaining but never doing anything about it the time for empty talk is over  now arrives the hour of action 
do not allow anyone to tell you it cannot be done  no challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of america  we will not fail  our country will thrive and prosper again 
we stand at the birth of a new millennium  ready to unlock the mysteries of space  to free the earth from the miseries of disease  to harvest the energies  industries and technologies of tomorrow 
a new national pride will stir ourselves  lift our sights and heal our divisions  it’s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget  that whether we are black or brown or white  we all bleed the same red blood of patriots 
we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great american flag and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of detroit or the windswept plains of nebraska  they look at the same night sky  and dream the same dreams  and they are infused with the breath by the same almighty creator 
so to all americans in every city near and far  small and large  from mountain to mountain  from ocean to ocean – hear these words – you will never be ignored again 
your voice  your hopes and dreams will define your american destiny your courage  goodness and love will forever guide us along the way 
together we will make america strong again  we will make america wealthy again  we will make america safe again and yes – together we will make america great again 
thank you 
god bless you 
and god bless america
