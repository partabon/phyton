as you might imagine  for barack  running for president is nothing compared to that first game of basketball with my brother  craig 

i can t tell you how much it means to have craig and my mom here tonight  like craig  i can feel my dad looking down on us  just as i ve felt his presence in every grace filled moment of my life 

at 6 foot 6  i ve often felt like craig was looking down on me too     literally  but the truth is  both when we were kids and today  he wasn t looking down on me  he was watching over me 

and he s been there for me every step of the way since that clear february day 19 months ago  when — with little more than our faith in each other and a hunger for change — we joined my husband  barack obama  on the improbable journey that s brought us to this moment 

but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey 

i come here tonight as a sister  blessed with a brother who is my mentor  my protector and my lifelong friend 

i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president 

i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world — they re the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning  and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night  their future — and all our children s future — is my stake in this election 

and i come here as a daughter — raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me  my mother s love has always been a sustaining force for our family  and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity  her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters 

my dad was our rock  although he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in his early 30s  he was our provider  our champion  our hero  as he got sicker  it got harder for him to walk  it took him longer to get dressed in the morning  but if he was in pain  he never let on  he never stopped smiling and laughing — even while struggling to button his shirt  even while using two canes to get himself across the room to give my mom a kiss  he just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder 

he and my mom poured everything they had into me and craig  it was the greatest gift a child can receive  never doubting for a single minute that you re loved  and cherished  and have a place in this world  and thanks to their faith and hard work  we both were able to go on to college  so i know firsthand from their lives — and mine — that the american dream endures 

and you know  what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name  even though he d grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii  his family was so much like mine  he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents  and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did  like my family  they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves  and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values  that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you re going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect  even if you don t know them  and even if you don t agree with them 

and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values  and pass them on to the next generation  because we want our children — and all children in this nation — to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them 

and as our friendship grew  and i learned more about barack  he introduced me to the work he d done when he first moved to chicago after college  instead of heading to wall street  barack had gone to work in neighborhoods devastated when steel plants shut down and jobs dried up  and he d been invited back to speak to people from those neighborhoods about how to rebuild their community 

the people gathered together that day were ordinary folks doing the best they could to build a good life  they were parents living paycheck to paycheck; grandparents trying to get by on a fixed income; men frustrated that they couldn t support their families after their jobs disappeared  those folks weren t asking for a handout or a shortcut  they were ready to work — they wanted to contribute  they believed — like you and i believe — that america should be a place where you can make it if you try 

barack stood up that day  and spoke words that have stayed with me ever since  he talked about  the world as it is  and  the world as it should be   and he said that all too often  we accept the distance between the two  and settle for the world as it is — even when it doesn t reflect our values and aspirations  but he reminded us that we know what our world should look like  we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like  and he urged us to believe in ourselves — to find the strength within ourselves to strive for the world as it should be  and isn t that the great american story?

it s the story of men and women gathered in churches and union halls  in town squares and high school gyms — people who stood up and marched and risked everything they had — refusing to settle  determined to mold our future into the shape of our ideals 

it is because of their will and determination that this week  we celebrate two anniversaries  the 88th anniversary of women winning the right to vote  and the 45th anniversary of that hot summer day when  dr  martin luther king jr   lifted our sights and our hearts with his dream for our nation 

i stand here today at the crosscurrents of that history — knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me  all of them driven by the same conviction that drove my dad to get up an hour early each day to painstakingly dress himself for work  the same conviction that drives the men and women i ve met all across this country 

people who work the day shift  kiss their kids goodnight  and head out for the night shift — without disappointment  without regret — that goodnight kiss a reminder of everything they re working for 

the military families who say grace each night with an empty seat at the table  the servicemen and women who love this country so much  they leave those they love most to defend it 

the young people across america serving our communities — teaching children  cleaning up neighborhoods  caring for the least among us each and every day 

people like hillary clinton  who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling  so that our daughters — and sons — can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher 

people like joe biden  who s never forgotten where he came from and never stopped fighting for folks who work long hours and face long odds and need someone on their side again 

all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just won t do — that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be 

that is the thread that connects our hearts  that is the thread that runs through my journey and barack s journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight  where the current of history meets this new tide of hope 

that is why i love this country 

and in my own life  in my own small way  i ve tried to give back to this country that has given me so much  that s why i left a job at a law firm for a career in public service  working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities  because i believe that each of us — no matter what our age or background or walk of life — each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation 

it s a belief barack shares — a belief at the heart of his life s work 

it s what he did all those years ago  on the streets of chicago  setting up job training to get people back to work and after school programs to keep kids safe — working block by block to help people lift up their families 

it s what he did in the illinois senate  moving people from welfare to jobs  passing tax cuts for hard working families  and making sure women get equal pay for equal work 

it s what he s done in the united states senate  fighting to ensure the men and women who serve this country are welcomed home not just with medals and parades but with good jobs and benefits and health care — including mental health care 

that s why he s running — to end the war in iraq responsibly  to build an economy that lifts every family  to make health care available for every american  and to make sure every child in this nation gets a world class education all the way from preschool to college  that s what barack obama will do as president of the united states of america 

he ll achieve these goals the same way he always has — by bringing us together and reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are  you see  barack doesn t care where you re from  or what your background is  or what party — if any — you belong to  that s not how he sees the world  he knows that thread that connects us — our belief in america s promise  our commitment to our children s future — is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree 

it was strong enough to bring hope to those neighborhoods in chicago 

it was strong enough to bring hope to the mother he met worried about her child in iraq; hope to the man who s unemployed  but can t afford gas to find a job; hope to the student working nights to pay for her sister s health care  sleeping just a few hours a day 

and it was strong enough to bring hope to people who came out on a cold iowa night and became the first voices in this chorus for change that s been echoed by millions of americans from every corner of this nation 

millions of americans who know that barack understands their dreams; that barack will fight for people like them; and that barack will finally bring the change we need 

and in the end  after all that s happened these past 19 months  the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago  he s the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer  inching along at a snail s pace  peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror  feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands  determined to give her everything he d struggled so hard for himself  determined to give her what he never had  the affirming embrace of a father s love 

and as i tuck that little girl and her little sister into bed at night  i think about how one day  they ll have families of their own  and one day  they — and your sons and daughters — will tell their own children about what we did together in this election  they ll tell them how this time  we listened to our hopes  instead of our fears  how this time  we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming  how this time  in this great country — where a girl from the south side of chicago can go to college and law school  and the son of a single mother from hawaii can go all the way to the white house – we committed ourselves to building the world as it should be 

so tonight  in honor of my father s memory and my daughters  future — out of gratitude to those whose triumphs we mark this week  and those whose everyday sacrifices have brought us to this moment — let us devote ourselves to finishing their work; let us work together to fulfill their hopes; and let us stand together to elect barack obama president of the united states of america 

thank you  god bless you  and god bless america
