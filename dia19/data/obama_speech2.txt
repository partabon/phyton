my fellow citizens i stand here today humbled by the task before us  grateful for the trust you have bestowed  mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors  i thank president bush for his service to our nation  as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition 
forty four americans have now taken the presidential oath  the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace  yet  every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms  at these moments  america has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office  but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers  and true to our founding documents 
so it has been  so it must be with this generation of americans 

that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood  our nation is at war  against a far reaching network of violence and hatred  our economy is badly weakened  a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some  but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age  homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered  our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet 

these are the indicators of crisis  subject to data and statistics  less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land   a nagging fear that america s decline is inevitable  and that the next generation must lower its sights 

today i say to you that the challenges we face are real  they are serious and they are many 

they will not be met easily or in a short span of time  but know this  america   they will be met  on this day  we gather because we have chosen hope over fear  unity of purpose over conflict and discord 

on this day  we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises  the recriminations and worn out dogmas  that for far too long have strangled our politics 

we remain a young nation  but in the words of scripture  the time has come to set aside childish things  the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift  that noble idea  passed on from generation to generation  the god given promise that all are equal  all are free  and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness 

in reaffirming the greatness of our nation  we understand that greatness is never a given  it must be earned  our journey has never been one of short cuts or settling for less  it has not been the path for the faint hearted   for those who prefer leisure over work  or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame  rather  it has been the risk takers  the doers  the makers of things   some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor  who have carried us up the long  rugged path towards prosperity and freedom 

for us  they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life 

for us  they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth 
for us  they fought and died  in places like concord and gettysburg; normandy and khe sahn  time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life  they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction 

this is the journey we continue today  we remain the most prosperous  powerful nation on earth  our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began  our minds are no less inventive  our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year  our capacity remains undiminished  but our time of standing pat  of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions   that time has surely passed  starting today  we must pick ourselves up  dust ourselves off  and begin again the work of remaking america 

for everywhere we look  there is work to be done  the state of the economy calls for action  bold and swift  and we will act   not only to create new jobs  but to lay a new foundation for growth  we will build the roads and bridges  the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together  we will restore science to its rightful place  and wield technology s wonders to raise health care s quality and lower its cost  we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories  and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age  all this we can do  and all this we will do 

now  there are some who question the scale of our ambitions   who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans  their memories are short  for they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose  and necessity to courage 

what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them   that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply  the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small  but whether it works   whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage  care they can afford  a retirement that is dignified  where the answer is yes  we intend to move forward  where the answer is no  programs will end  and those of us who manage the public s dollars will be held to account   to spend wisely  reform bad habits  and do our business in the light of day   because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government 

nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill  its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched  but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye  the market can spin out of control   and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous  the success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product  but on the reach of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart   not out of charity  but because it is the surest route to our common good 

as for our common defense  we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals  our founding fathers  faced with perils we can scarcely imagine  drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man  a charter expanded by the blood of generations  those ideals still light the world  and we will not give them up for expedience s sake  and so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today  from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born  know that america is a friend of each nation and every man  woman  and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity  and that we are ready to lead once more 

recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks  but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions  they understood that our power alone cannot protect us  nor does it entitle us to do as we please  instead  they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause  the force of our example  the tempering qualities of humility and restraint 

we are the keepers of this legacy  guided by these principles once more  we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort   even greater cooperation and understanding between nations  we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people  and forge a hard earned peace in afghanistan  with old friends and former foes  we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat  and roll back the specter of a warming planet  we will not apologize for our way of life  nor will we waver in its defense  and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents  we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us  and we will defeat you 

for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength  not a weakness  we are a nation of christians and muslims  jews and hindus   and non believers  we are shaped by every language and culture  drawn from every end of this earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation  and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united  we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller  our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace 

to the muslim world  we seek a new way forward  based on mutual interest and mutual respect 

to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict  or blame their society s ills on the west   know that your people will judge you on what you can build  not what you destroy  to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent  know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist 

to the people of poor nations  we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds  and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty  we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world s resources without regard to effect  for the world has changed  and we must change with it 

as we consider the road that unfolds before us  we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who  at this very hour  patrol far off deserts and distant mountains  they have something to tell us today  just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages 

we honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty  but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves  and yet  at this moment   a moment that will define a generation   it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all 

for as much as government can do and must do  it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies  it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break  the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours  it is the firefighter s courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke  but also a parent s willingness to nurture a child  that finally decides our fate 

our challenges may be new  the instruments with which we meet them may be new  but those values upon which our success depends   hard work and honesty  courage and fair play  tolerance and curiosity  loyalty and patriotism   these things are old  these things are true  they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history  what is demanded then is a return to these truths  what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility   a recognition  on the part of every american  that we have duties to ourselves  our nation  and the world  duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly  firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit  so defining of our character  than giving our all to a difficult task 

this is the price and the promise of citizenship 

this is the source of our confidence   the knowledge that god calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny 

this is the meaning of our liberty and our creed   why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall  and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath 

so let us mark this day with remembrance  of who we are and how far we have traveled  in the year of america s birth  in the coldest of months  a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river  the capital was abandoned  the enemy was advancing  the snow was stained with blood  at a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt  the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people 

 let it be told to the future world   that in the depth of winter  when nothing but hope and virtue could survive   that the city and the country  alarmed at one common danger  came forth to meet  it   

america  in the face of our common dangers  in this winter of our hardship  let us remember these timeless words  with hope and virtue  let us brave once more the icy currents  and endure what storms may come  let it be said by our children s children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end  that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and god s grace upon us  we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations
